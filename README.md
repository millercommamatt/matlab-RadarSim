# RadarSim
A library of Matlab functions which allow a user to sample a 3D array in much the same way as a precipitation radar.

A user can define various radar properties including antenna location, elevation, range, beamwidth, elevations, and gate spacings.

The resulting polar coordinate array can then be explored, analyzed, and plotting using standard Matlab functions.

The library was used in the paper *Detecting Wave Features in Doppler Radial Velocity Radar Observations*. The scripts in the `examples` folder can be used to recreated Figures 3 and 4 from that paper.
